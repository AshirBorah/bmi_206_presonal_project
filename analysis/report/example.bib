               therapies in the clinic is challenging. Here, we report how
               cancer-driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from 29
               tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy number alterations,

               molecularly annotated human cancer cell lines and correlated
               with sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines
               faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in
               tumors, find that many of these associate with drug
               sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue
               lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling

Generally, genomic features are regarded as the state-of-the-art method for stratifying patients for targeted therapies. In this work, we conduct the first rigorous comparison of DNA- and expression-based predictive models for viability across five datasets encompassing chemical and genetic perturbations. We find that expression consistently outperforms DNA for predicting vulnerabilities, including many currently stratified by canonical DNA markers. Contrary to their perception in the literature, the most accurate expression-based models depend on few features and are amenable to biological interpretation. This work points to the importance of exploring more comprehensive expression profiling in clinical settings.Competing Interest StatementT.R.G. is a paid consultant to GlaxoSmithKiline, is a co-founder of Sherlock Biosciences and FORMA Therapeutics, and receives sponsored research funding from BayerHealthCare, Calico Life Sciences and Novo Ventures.

The artifacts often survive existing preprocessing pipelines, masquerade as epigenetic alterations and can confound discoveries in epigenome-wide association studies and studies of methylation-quantitative trait loci. We implement a solution, P-value with out-of-band (OOB) array hybridization (pOOBAH), in the R package SeSAMe. Our method effectively masks deleted and hyperpolymorphic regions, reducing or eliminating spurious reports of epigenetic silencing at oft-deleted tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A and RB1 in cases with somatic deletions. Furthermore, our method substantially decreases technical variation whilst retaining biological variation, both within and across HM450 and EPIC platform measurements. SeSAMe provides a light-weight, modular DNA methylation data analysis suite, with a performant implementation suitable for efficient analysis of thousands of samples.}",

	abstract = {Hundreds of genome-wide loss-of-function screens have been performed, as part of efforts such as The Cancer Dependency Map, to create a catalog of genetic dependencies in a diverse set of cancer contexts. In recent years, large-scale screening efforts have shifted perturbation technology from RNAi to CRISPR-Cas9, due to the superior efficacy and specificity of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated approaches. However, questions remain about the extent to which partial suppression of gene targets could result in selective dependency across cell lines, potentially revealing a larger set of targetable cancer vulnerabilities than can be identified using CRISPR knockout alone. Here, we use CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi screening data for more than 400 shared cell lines to represent knockout and partial suppression genetic perturbation modalities and evaluate the utility of each for therapeutic target discovery and the inference of gene function. We find that CRISPR screens identify more dependencies, and yield more accurate predictive models and co-dependency relationships overall. However, RNAi outperforms CRISPR in identifying associations (omics, drug, co-dependencies) with genes that are common dependencies for most cell lines (pan-dependencies). As pan-dependencies occur frequently in the CRISPR dataset (~2,000 genes), using results from both RNAi and CRISPR analyses facilitates the discovery of predictive models and associated co-dependencies for a wider range of gene targets than could be detected using either dataset alone. These findings can aid in the interpretation of contrasting results obtained from CRISPR and RNAi screens and reinforce the importance of partial gene suppression methods in building a cancer dependency map.Competing Interest StatementB.R.P. and F.V. receive research support from Novo Ventures.

               However, its expression, biological function, and underlying
               mechanism of action in most solid tumors remain largely unknown.
               We postulated that EBF1 has a role in the pathophysiology of
               CRC. Analysis of EBF1 mRNA expression in CRC tumor samples from
               several public databases and directly from banked tissues
               revealed that EBF1 mRNA expression is lower in CRC tissue
               compared to non-cancerous colorectal tissue. Survival analysis
               of multiple datasets revealed that low EBF1 expression was
               correlated with shorter overall survival, relapse-free survival,
               and event-free survival in CRC patients. Transduction of
               lentivirus encoding full length EBF1 followed by in vitro and in
               vivo assays demonstrated that EBF1 over-expression in CRC cell
               lines suppresses cell growth by inhibiting cell viability, cell
               survival, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
               Mechanistic investigation indicated that EBF1 over-expression
               down-regulates PNO1 mRNA and protein expression, as well as
               transcriptional activity while up-regulating the expression of
               p53 and p21 proteins. These findings suggest that EBF1 is a

Genetic networks are characterized by extensive buffering. During tumor evolution, disruption of functional redundancies can create de novo vulnerabilities that are specific to cancer cells. Here, we systematically search for cancer-relevant paralog interactions using CRISPR screens and publicly available loss-of-function datasets. Our analysis reveals >2,000 candidate dependencies, several of which we validate experimentally, including CSTF2-CSTF2T, DNAJC15-DNAJC19, FAM50A-FAM50B, and RPP25-RPP25L. We provide evidence that RPP25L can physically and functionally compensate for the absence of RPP25 as a member of the RNase P/MRP complexes in tRNA processing. Our analysis also reveals unexpected redundancies between sex chromosome genes. We show that chrX- and chrY-encoded paralogs, such as ZFX-ZFY, DDX3X-DDX3Y, and EIF1AX-EIF1AY, are functionally linked. Tumor cell lines from male patients with loss of chromosome Y become dependent on the chrX-encoded gene. We propose targeting of chrX-encoded paralogs as a general therapeutic strategy for human tumors that have lost the Y chromosome.}
